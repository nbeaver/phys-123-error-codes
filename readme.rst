These codes function as grading shorthand,
similar to proofreading marks.
Rather than writing out
"the quantities in this graph are correct, but the axes need to be reversed",
the grader can simply write "82" on the graph,
and the student can look up what the code means later.

This list fits on two sides of a double-sided sheet.
